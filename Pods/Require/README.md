Require lets you easily require `Optional` values to be non-`nil`, or crash gracefully.

Sometimes you have optional values in your code that are not really optional, and will cause your
application to enter an undefined state if `nil`. Require makes it easy to avoid such states, by
causing a crash with rich debug information, to enable you to much easier hunt down & fix the bug.

## Usage

Call `require()` on any `Optional`, optionally giving a `hint` for debugging purposes:

```swift
class ConfigurationLoader {
    func load() -> Configuration {
        let data = readJSONFile().require(hint: "Verify that Config.JSON is valid")
        let config: Configuration? = try? unbox(data: data)
        return config.require()
    }
}
```
